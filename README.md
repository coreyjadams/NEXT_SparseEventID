# NEXT Sparse Event Identification

This repository contains some networks to do signal/background separation.  The initial push will contain networks based on a Residual architecture in both dense and sparse implementations.

Dependencies:
 - larcv3 (for IO)
 - pytorch (for training)
 - horovod (for distributed training)
 - tensorboardX (for logging of training data)
 - SparseConvNet (for sparse networks)


Eventually, I want to add PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN (Edgeconvs for graph networks)
